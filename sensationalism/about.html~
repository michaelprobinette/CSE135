						<h1>Impact</h1>
						<p> Media experts speculate that the coming of The Sensationalist marks the beginning of the end for modern media. Many are calling
						it "the best thing they've ever seen" and as chaos ransacks the nation in wake of individuals simply abandoning interest in
						all other facets of media. Upon going live, FOX news, MSNBC, The Onion, and several others have already declared backrupcy in anticipation
						of the coming storm.</p>
